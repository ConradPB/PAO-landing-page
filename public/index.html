            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 1: Create a Profile</h3>
                <p>Every week our algorithms set up dinners with 6 people of faith based on their profiles.</p>

                <h3>Step 2: Match & Meet</h3>
                <p>We get you off the apps and to a dinner, completely arranged by PÃO. Just opt in and we do the rest.</p>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 3: A new way to fellowship</h3>
